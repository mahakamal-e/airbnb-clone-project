# Airbnb-Clone-Project
## About the Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb. It involves a deep dive into full-stack development, focusing on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. This project enables learners to understand complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Learning Objective

This project is tailored to enhance your expertise in modern software development practices. By completing these tasks, learners will:

- Master collaborative team workflows using GitHub.
- Deepen their understanding of backend architecture and database design principles.
- Implement advanced security measures for API development.
- Gain proficiency in designing and managing CI/CD pipelines for efficient deployment.
- Strengthen their ability to document and plan complex software projects effectively.
- Develop an understanding of integrating technologies like Django, MySQL, and GraphQL in a unified ecosystem.

## Team Roles

### Business Analyst (BA)
Analyzes user and business needs and translates them into clear project requirements for the development team.

### Product Owner (PO)
Defines the product vision, manages the product backlog, and ensures the team delivers value to users.

### Project Manager (PM)
Coordinates the team, monitors progress, removes blockers, and ensures timely delivery.

### UI/UX Designer
Designs intuitive user interfaces and ensures the application provides an excellent user experience.

### Software Architect
Defines the technical architecture of the application, including tech stack choices and code structure guidelines.

### Backend Developer
Implements server-side logic, API endpoints, and integrates with databases and third-party services.

### Frontend Developer
Builds the client-side of the application, interacting with APIs and creating responsive UIs.

### Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs and manages the database schema, ensures performance, security, and data integrity.

### QA Engineer
Tests the application manually to ensure it meets the required standards and functions as intended.

### Test Automation Engineer
Creates automated tests to continuously validate the applicationâ€™s features.

### DevOps Engineer
Manages CI/CD pipelines, deployment environments, and ensures smooth operations of the application lifecycle.

## Technology Stack

- **Django**: Web framework used for building the backend and RESTful APIs.
- **MySQL**: Relational database system used to store application data.
- **GraphQL**: API query language for flexible data retrieval.
- **Docker**: Containerization platform to standardize application environments.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD tool for automating workflows, testing, and deployments.

## Database Design

### Entities and Fields

- **User**: id, name, email, password, role
- **Property**: id, title, location, description, price_per_night, owner_id
- **Booking**: id, user_id, property_id, check_in, check_out, total_price
- **Review**: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment
- **Payment**: id, booking_id, payment_method, amount, status

### Relationships
- A user can own multiple properties.
- A user can make multiple bookings.
- Each booking is for one property.
- Each review is tied to a user and a property.
- Each booking can have one payment record.

## Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**: Registration, login, and profile management with role-based access control.
- **Property Management**: Hosts can create, edit, and manage their property listings.
- **Booking System**: Users can search, book properties, and view their reservations.
- **Review System**: Users can leave reviews and ratings for properties they've booked.
- **Payment System**: Secure payment processing for bookings.

## API Security

- **Authentication**: JWT-based login system to validate user identity.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access to ensure only permitted users can access specific endpoints.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting request rates.
- **Data Validation & Sanitization**: Ensures only valid and secure data enters the system.
- **HTTPS & Encryption**: Secures data in transit and sensitive data storage.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD pipelines automate building, testing, and deploying the application:

- **CI (Continuous Integration)**: Code is automatically tested and built on each push (e.g., via GitHub Actions).
- **CD (Continuous Deployment)**: Automatically deploys successful builds to staging or production.
- **Tools**: GitHub Actions, Docker, possibly AWS/GCP for deployment.
